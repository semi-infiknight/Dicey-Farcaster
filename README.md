Send Arcade leverages the power of blinks to build gaming/gamification consumer products.
We started with shipping games on blinks to build our userbase. 
We are now expanding to building a full-fledged gaming platform that uses the teleporting capabilities of blinks.

## Checkmate
[https://github.com/SendArcade/Checkmate](https://github.com/SendArcade/Checkmate)

The first-ever community chess game on Twitter/X, powered by Blinks.

⚫️⚪️ Each player makes a move as Black or White.
💰 Play with SOL; if your team wins, earn rewards.

CheckMate is a variation designed to make chess community-driven, fun, and rewarding

1. Check the latest game state and check whether it's Black's or White's turn to play through.

2. The player makes their move by either:
–– selecting one of the 4 suggested moves, or
–– entering a custom move in the input box (e.g., F2F3 means moving the piece from F2 to F3).

3. The bet amount is calculated based on your side's winning odds.
Higher winning odds → Higher bet amount.

4. All pooled funds are distributed to the winning side after the game ends.
