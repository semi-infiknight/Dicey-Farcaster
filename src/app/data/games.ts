  //   CheckMate is a variation designed to make chess community-driven, fun, and rewarding –– made possible with Blinks!

  //   1️⃣ Check the latest game state and check whether it's Black's or White's turn to play through.

  //   2️⃣ The player makes their move by either:
  //   –– selecting one of the 4 suggested moves, or
  //   –– entering a custom move in the input box (e.g., F2F3 means moving the piece from F2 to F3).

  //   3️⃣ The bet amount is calculated based on your side's winning odds.

  //   Higher winning odds → Higher bet amount.

  //   4️⃣ All pooled funds are distributed to the winning side after the game ends.`,
